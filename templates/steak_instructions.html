      In the next section you will be presented with multiple different alternative packages of beef ribeye steak that could be available for purchase in a retail store where you typically shop. Besides the attributes presented for each choice, each product possesses the same characteristics (e.g., similar color and freshness) and is produced in the U.S. Prices vary for each product and are all in $/lb. units. Each option will be described along several attributes including things like price or certification. By hovering over each attribute you can see a description of what they mean. Steaks can have one of three certification labels: USDA, third party, and self. Typical steaks have no certification, while USDA and third party certification labels mean that all processes and claims from the manufacturer have been verified by either the USDA or a third party (for instance, Food Alliance). Self certification labels mean that the manufacturer itself verifies its claims. Please remember what the meat certification label means, we will ask you later to check if you read this.

      For this experiment, please imagine that you actually want a ribeye steak. We are interested in how people trade off the cost of the steak with other, non-price characteristics. However, the experience from previous similar surveys is that people often put less importance on the price of the product when they don't actually have to buy anything in the end. For instance, a recent study asked people whether they would purchase a new product similar to the one you are about to be asked about. This purchase was hypothetical (as it will be for you) in that no one actually had to pay money when they indicated a willingness to purchase. In the study, 80% of people said they would buy the new product, but when a grocery store actually stocked the product, only 43% of people actually bought the new product when they had to pay for it. This difference (43% vs. 80%) is what we refer to as hypothetical bias. Please remember this number combination (43% vs 80%) as we will ask about it later to check if you read this.

      In order for this research to work, it is important that you make each of your upcoming selections like you would if you were actually facing these exact choices in a store, i.e., noting that buying a product means that you would have less money available for other purchases.
