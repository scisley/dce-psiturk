      In this experiment, you will be shown various types of refrigerators. Each option will be described along several attributes including things like price or configuration. You will be presented with a series of choices, each involving two options. Please assume that everything else about the products is the same. For instance, the dimensions of the refrigerator are left unspecified, please assume all products have the same dimensions.
    </p>

      For this experiment, please imagine that you actually need a new refrigerator. We are interested in how people trade off the cost of the refrigerator with other, non-price characteristics. However, the experience from previous similar surveys is that people often put less importance on the price of the product when they don't actually have to buy anything in the end. For instance, a recent study asked people whether they would purchase a new product similar to the one you are about to be asked about. This purchase was hypothetical (as it will be for you) in that no one actually had to pay money when they indicated a willingness to purchase. In the study, 80% of people said they would buy the new product, but when a grocery store actually stocked the product, only 43% of people actually bought the new product when they had to pay for it. This difference (43% vs. 80%) is what we refer to as hypothetical bias. Please remember this number combination (43% vs 80%) as we will ask about it later to check if you read this.

      In order for this research to work, it is important that you make each of your upcoming selections like you would if you were actually facing these exact choices in a store, i.e., noting that buying a product means that you would have less money available for other purchases.
