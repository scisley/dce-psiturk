      In this experiment, you will be shown various types of travel modes. Each option will be described along several attributes including things like price or time travelled. You will be presented with a series of choices, each involving two options. Please assume that everything else about the services is the same. For instance, the comfort of the modes are left unspecified, please assume all modes have the same comfort level.

      For this experiment please imagine that you have just gotten a new job which pays you $45,000 per year, and that you have to choose your new commute. We are interested in how people trade off the cost of the commute with other, non-price characteristics. However, the experience from previous similar surveys is that people often put less importance on the price when they don't actually have to pay for anything. For instance, a recent study asked people whether they would purchase a new product. This purchase was hypothetical (as your choice is) in that no one actually had to pay money when they indicated a willingness to purchase. In the study, 80% of people said they would buy the new product, but when a grocery store actually stocked the product, only 43% of people actually bought the new product when they had to pay for it. This difference (43% vs. 80%) is what we refer to as hypothetical bias. Please remember this number combination (43% vs 80%) as we will ask about it later to check if you read this.

      In order for this research to work, it is important that you make each of your upcoming selections like you would if you were actually facing these exact choices in your commute, i.e., noting that money spent on a toll cannot be spent on other things later on.
