DCE-PSITURK
==================

This code can be used to replicate the discrete choice experiments conducted by the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](www.nrel.gov) that were presented at the 2016 [BECC conference](http://beccconference.org/) by [Steven Isley](https://scisley.github.io/).

This experiments consists of four sub-experiments about willingness to pay. All focus on how consumers use (or do not use) carbon information to make choices. The products are:

* shirts - shirts with different levels of price, organic cotton, sustainablilty and production labeling
* refrigerators - refrigerators with different prices, features (capacity,ice maker, etc)
* ribeye steaks - steaks with different price and certifications
* commute options - commutes with different times, variablility, safety, tolls
    
This code relies on the open source package [PsiTurk](https://psiturk.org/ee/). Please download and install that first before trying to run this experiment. Windows will not work. If you use Windows, you will need to install a virtual machine with linux installed (try googling "virtualbox" if you're unsure how to get started).
